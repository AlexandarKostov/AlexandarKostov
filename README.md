Proficiency in a wide range of technologies empowers me to craft seamless user experiences. I am adept at harnessing the power of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, SQL, PHP, GIT, JavaScript,REST API, jQuery, AJAX, and Laravel to create dynamic and responsive apps. My comprehensive understanding of these frameworks allows me to develop scalable and future-proof solutions.
